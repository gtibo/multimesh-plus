# Multimesh +

The aim of this project is to explore minimal editing functionality for the `MultiMeshInstance3D` node. Please note that this plugin is still in the very early stages of development. As such, I cannot guarantee that it will work properly on your project.

### Known Issues

- A mismatch between the `MultiMeshPlus3D` node data block and the plugin can happen.
	- Make sure your data block doesn't contain empty entries.
	- Deselect and reselect the `MultiMeshPlus3D` node to force plugin update.
- The Undo / Redo feature can be a bit buggy sometimes.
